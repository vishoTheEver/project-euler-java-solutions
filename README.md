Taking a deep dive into the intricate realms of mathematics and computer science, this repository symbolizes my quest to conquer the computational and algorithmic challenges presented by Project Euler, all through the power of Java.

Leonhard Euler's legacy is not just marked by his vast contributions to mathematics, but also by the flame of inquiry that every enthusiast carries. This repository is an ode to that spirit.

## üìò About Project Euler

Project Euler offers an extensive set of challenges blending computer science with mathematics. Each problem varies in complexity, urging users to seek optimized solutions. It's often said that an efficient answer should execute in less than a minute. Yet, for many enthusiasts, the real joy is found not just in the destination but in the voyage of exploration and learning.

## üîç Repository Structure

- `src/`: The primary directory housing all source code.
  - `main/java/`: Contains the core algorithms and methods.
    - `Problems.java`: Contains algorithms tailored to solve the Project Euler problems.
    - `ProblemsDriver.java`: The main driver, executing the solutions.
  - `test/java/`: Holds the JUnit tests for each solution.
    - `SolutionsTest.java`: JUnit tests for every solution in `Problems.java`.
- `pom.xml`: Maven's Project Object Model file, managing project dependencies, notably JUnit for testing.
- `README.md`: The very guide you're reading now!
- `LICENSE`: Outlines the rights and constraints associated with the project.

## üßÆ Problem Showcase

| ID | Title |
|----|-------|
| 1  | Multiples of 3 and 5 |
| 2  | Even Fibonacci numbers |
| ...| ... |
| 850| Fractions of Powers |
| 851| SOP and POS |

For a comprehensive list and details, dive into the `Problems.java` file within `src/main/java/`.

## üí° Commitment

Parallel to my Python endeavor, I've pledged to solve a problem every day in Java. This repository stands as a testament to that commitment, capturing the unique flair Java brings to problem-solving.

## üìö Usage

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/vishoTheEver/project-euler-java-solutions.git`
2. Navigate to the repository directory: `cd project-euler-java-solutions`
3. Compile and run the `ProblemsDriver.java` to see the solutions in action.
4. For testing, ensure Maven and JUnit are set up. Execute tests using: `mvn test`

## ü§ù Contributing

While Project Euler maintains the charm of discovery by granting discussion access only post-solution, this repository can serve as a beacon for those seeking hints or discussions around the problem's intricacies. Yet, as esteemed mathematicians would advise, the real essence lies in the journey, not just the end.

Your contributions, optimizations, and insights are invaluable. If you have ideas or refined solutions, open a pull request. Ensure your solutions are tested against the provided JUnit test cases in `SolutionsTest.java`.
